# Abandoned

__29 August 2015:__
This module is currently abandoned.  I might get back to it someday. We'll see...


# CardGame

This is a set of tools for use in Elixir projects to create and run a card game.  It is loosely based on [the Perl module Games::Cards](http://search.cpan.org/~akarger/Games-Cards-1.45/lib/Games/Cards.pm#Games::Cards::Deck)

The modules to be included here are:

 * Card
 * Deck
 * Hand
 * Pile
 * Stack
 * Queue (maybe, I'm not sure yet.)

We'll be using a map for our card structure, and lists of those maps to create Decks, Hands, etc. 

** TODO: Most of the above **

I'm just starting.  And I'm test-driving it all, too.
